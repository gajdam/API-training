# API-training
Repo created for the subject at the university - specialized tool software, to learn how to test servers and tools for this purpose
## Why this API
To be honest I was going to use some API related to geocoding, because I will use it for my thesis, but then I saw an API related to cats - which I love and have a cat myself
https://thecatapi.com/
## What I'll be testing
**CatsAPI:**
- GET image-info
- GET image
- GET favs/id
- POST upload image
- POST votes
- POST fav
- DELETE image
**Goals API** - API created by my group at the univeristy:
- GET all-goals
- GET goals-by-username
- POST id-progress
- POST id-archive
- PUT goal
- DELETE goal
## What I will be testing with
I will be using postman both web and desktop because I sometimes interact with it at work
